When he was 16, his mother died by suicide. Fedup of his tumultuous life in Junagadh, his father shifted the family to Mumbai in 2007, to make a fresh start.</li></ul><ul><li>In 2008, his father fell sick and became bedridden. Therefore, he had to take charge of his family at the age of 17. Thereafter, he assumed the responsibility of his three sisters’ marriage. To make ends meet, he worked during the day and pursued a computer course in the evening.</li></ul><ul><li>Before becoming a standup comedian, Faruqui worked as a utensil seller, a salesman, in a shop.</li></ul><ul><li>In his early twenties, Faruqui worked as a graphic designer in a reputable firm, where he discovered that he was good at coming up with witty one-liners for posters.</li></ul><ul><li>Faruqui decided to venture into stand-up comedy while pursuing one of his odd jobs. Apparently, he was present on the shooting set of an advertisement in which the makers were replicating a stand-up comedy scene. As the makers of the advertisement fell short on the extras, they asked Munawar to sit and pose as an audience. Thereafter, the makers asked him to go on the stage and say two lines. While delivering those lines Faruqui felt the urge to begin his career in the comedy business. While talking about this incident in an interview, Faruqui’s friend Balraj Singh Ghai said,He said when he went on stage and said those two lines, it felt powerful, like it was something he should do for real. He came for some of our open mics and became an instant hit.”</li></ul><ul><li>Intrigued by standup comedy, he started visiting open mics. Although at home his family encouraged their children to pursue a career of their choice, they initially dismissed standup as “time-pass” when Faruqui began to show an interest in it. It was when people started approaching him for selfies that his family realised that stand-up comedy was a full-time profession.</li></ul><ul><li>In July 2019, he performed his first one hour Gujarati show titled “Dodh Dahyo” in Malad, Mumbai. <img decoding=async data-expand=600 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bignamebio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/A-poster-for-Dodh-Dahyo-2019.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></li></ul><ul><li>He started uploading standup comedy videos on his self-titled YouTube channel in January 2020, and soon, he gained massive popularity.

In the same month, his father died. In an interview in 2021, while talking about his dilemma, he said,Last year has been testing. I lost my father in February, but also got my first shows in Mumbai, the same month. There have been days I’d be crying in the green room just before being called up to the stage.”</li></ul><ul><li>During the Covid-19 lockdown in 2020, Munawar Faruqi’s fictional character Razzaqbhai which he used in his Instagram videos, attracted many followers.</li></ul><ul><li>In April 2020, he struck stardom with the stand-up comedy video titled ‘Dawood, Yamraaj & Aurat,’ uploaded on his channel. In the video, Faruqui talked about his residential area, Dongri, a neighbourhood in South Mumbai known for fostering criminals like Dawood Ibrahim. He said,Have you heard of Dongri? Every time I mention it, half the people I’m speaking to don’t know what I’m talking about, and the other half turn around and say, ‘Oh, that Dawood wala?’ But what kind of stereotype is this? But Dongri isn’t famous just because of Dawood, there is Haji Mastan, Tiger Memon — what gangsters we’ve given.”<p>Immensely appreciated, the video has garnered over 10 million views.</p><img decoding=async data-expand=600 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bignamebio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Dawood-Yamraaj-Aurat-2020.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></li></ul><ul><li>After performing the set ‘Dongri to Nowhere’ for the first time in August 2019, in October 2020, he started its nationwide tour.
