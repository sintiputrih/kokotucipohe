After becoming the co-host in season 8 after Max Joseph's departure, Kamie stole the hearts of fans because of her compassionate personality and hilarious jokes. She also doesn't suffer fools, which is appreciated on a show like Catfish. Now that Kamie Crawford is also hosting Are You The One, which TV show pays her more money?</p><h2 id=how-much-was-kamie-crawford-paid-by-mtv>How Much Was Kamie Crawford Paid By MTV?</h2><p><a href=#>Manti Te'o's catfishing scandal</a> captivated people, and it makes sense that MTV's Catfish has been a hit since it first premiered in 2012. Every episode is full of mystery as Nev and Kamie try to get to the bottom of what's going on. Kamie and Nev are perfect co-hosts as their personalities are similar enough but contrast nicely.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Nev has been the host of Catfish since the very first episode and definitely has a lot of experience speaking to people who have been in dramatic and complicated online relationships. But Kamie adds some humor to the show and fans love her for it. Whether Kamie waves around a tiny red flag or says that she is skeptical about an episode, she has done a great job over the past few seasons.</p><p>At the beginning of part two of season 8, which premiered in early 2023, Nev shared that he would have a few guest co-hosts because Kamie was hosting Are You The One? Kamie has become a very successful TV host and it seems that she is making good money these days.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/kamie-crawford-catfish.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kamie Crawford made a deal</a> with MTV to host Catfish, Ex on the Beach, and Are You The One? according to Deadline. Her salary wasn't shared in the announcement. But, because she signed a new contract to host these three shows, it seems that Kamie must be getting paid more now than she has been for the past few seasons of Catfish. And it's definitely impressive.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Machine Gun Kelly Once Appeared On An Episode Of MTV's Catfish And Let His Anger Get The Best Of Him</a></span></p><p>According to Deadline, Kamie said of the news, “As a huge fan of reality TV centered around dating and working in the relationship advice space, it’s an absolute dream to now be hosting three shows based on finding love and making lifelong connections."</p><p>Kamie told Shadow And Act that it was thrilling to hear that she would be hosting these three shows. She said, “My first thought was, HOW? I thought there was no way that was even possible, but apparently, it is. I was so excited because I am such a huge fan of all three shows. So to be approached to host the shows is one thing, but for it to be [shows] that I am a fan of, that made it even better."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/kamie-crawford-catfish-scene.jpg><p>Kamie also mentioned that she has been working hard for a long time. It seems like this deal felt especially great because she has been putting in the time for many years. She said, “I’ve been working as a host for 11 years, I’m 30 now, and I’ve been trying to break into the business since I was 19. So I think this is an accumulation of all my work over the years."</p><p>Variety reported in March 2023 that Kamie Crawford signed with CAA. While Kamie's net worth isn't known, several websites such as Nicki Swift suggest it is around $2 million. This would definitely be a result of years of hard work and of co-hosting Catfish for season 8's many episodes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/kamie-crawford-2.jpg><p>It's exciting to watch Kamie host Are You The One? along with Ex on the Beach. She has a knack for telling it like it is and is incredibly smart. But Kamie is also super caring, and she's great at talking to people when they're feeling emotional or having a hard time. This makes her an empathetic Catfish co-host and also makes her a perfect addition to Are You The One? and Ex on the Beach.</p><h2 id=what-is-kamie-crawford-39-s-catfish-salary-and-is-it-true-that-she-quit>What Is Kamie Crawford's Catfish Salary And Is It True That She Quit?</h2><p>Although no one is certain of Kamie Crawford's Catfish salary, Distractify.com says that Nev Schulman's salary guesses have been all over the place.

She said "it was a completely different experience" because she spent time in Europe instead of traveling across the United States to film Catfish. She said the cast members of Are You The One? have "fun dates" and the show leans into the location.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Happened To Lauren And Derek, The Real Couple On MTV’s ‘Catfish’?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kamie Crawford's success in the reality TV world is definitely a culmination of years of working.
