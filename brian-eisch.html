So I went to get him, didn’t even think twice about it, you don’t leave a man behind, you don’t leave an ally behind, so we swung the vehicle around to go get the wounded Afghan guy and then get the hell out of there. We put the vehicle between us and the bad guys, and I climb out to grab the guy but when I get there I find that the guy is way too injured to just grab and throw in the vehicle, he was bleeding bad, going to bleed to death right there, so I start to throw a tourniquet on him…Then, suddenly I hear this snap, snap, snap then my legs start burning then it starts feeling like a chainsaw was hacking my legs, a Taliban sniper with an automatic weapon saw what we were doing, was waiting for us and shot under the vehicle and got me.”</p><img data-expand=600 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/getbiography.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Brian-Eisch-With-an-Afghan-Policeman-in-Afghanistan.jpg http viewbox style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-45492 class=wp-caption-text>Brian Eisch With an Afghan Policeman in Afghanistan</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Lost_His_Son></span><span class=ez-toc-section id=Lost_His_Son></span><span style=color:purple>Lost His Son</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In July 2015, Brian Eisch lost his youngest son, Joseph ‘Joey,’ in a road accident.

Brian couldn’t believe the news; as just a few minutes before, his son had pedaled away from the family’s Oswego County home in New York. Reportedly, when Joey asked his parents to go for a bike ride, they had urged him to ride carefully. While talking about it, Brian Eisch says,</p><p>The last words out of our mouth were, ‘We love you, buddy.”</p><p>According to the Oswego County Sheriff’s Office, around 12:41 pm, Joey was hit while riding his bike west on county Route 15, near Van Auken Road. Soon, he was rushed to Upstate University Hospital in Syracuse, where he later died on July 24, 2015. The Oswego County Sheriff’s Office identified the driver of the 2004 Chevrolet pickup that hit Joey as 71-year-old Ronald Blair of Kirkville. <span class=footnote_referrer_wpusm id=reflocid_5><a href=#>[5]</a></span> Following Joey’s death, it took years to Brian Eisch to come out of trauma.
