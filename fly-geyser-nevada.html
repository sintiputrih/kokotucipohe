remarkably beautiful sight. But perhaps most interestingly of all, Fly Geyser isn’t an altogether natural formation. In fact, it likely wouldn’t have existed at all if not for a combination of human involvement and geothermal pressure.</p><p>Here’s everything you need to know about the Fly Ranch Geyser and how it came to be.</p><i class="fa fa-times"></i> <span class=caption-body>Fly Geyser as seen from the air. </span><span class=credit>Duncan Rawlinson/Flickr</span> <span class=caption-body>A small group of people visiting Fly Geyser.</span><span class=credit>Matthew Dillon/Flickr</span> <span class=caption-body>Fly Geyser up close, where you can see the unique shape and color created by years of calcium carbonate deposits building up.</span><span class=credit>Harmony Ann Warren/Flickr</span> <span class=caption-body>Fly Geyser silhouetted against the sky and mountains.</span><span class=credit>Christie Hemm Klok for The Washington Post via Getty Images</span> <span class=caption-body>Fly Geyser, "a Rainbow of Colors" in Black Rock Desert, Nevada.</span><span class=credit>Bernard Friel/Education Images/Universal Images Group via Getty Images</span> <span class=caption-body>Steam pouring off of Fly Geyser.</span><span class=credit>Piyush Bakane/Flickr</span> <span class=caption-body>Fly Geyser as seen from a small distance, with the area around the mounds visible.</span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span> <span class=caption-body>July 19, 2019: A person swimming in the water near Fly Geyser.</span><span class=credit>Christie Hemm Klok for The Washington Post via Getty Images</span> <span class=caption-body>Fly Geyser Pool on Fly Ranch.</span><span class=credit>Education Images/Universal Images Group via Getty Images</span> <span class=caption-body>Fly Geyser in the morning at sunrise.</span> <span class=caption-body>Fly Geyser contrasted against the mountains.</span><span class=credit>Lauren Monitz/Getty Images</span> <span class=caption-body>Fly Geyser circa 2015.</span><span class=credit>Lukas Bischoff/Getty Images</span> <span class=caption-body>Fly Geyser erupting against a bright blue sky.</span><span class=credit>Education Images/Universal Images Group via Getty Images</span> <span class=caption-body>Fly Geyser at sunset.</span><span class=credit>Christie Hemm Klok for The Washington Post via Getty Images</span> <span class=caption-body>An aerial shot of Fly Geyser up close.</span><span class=credit>Steve Tietze/Getty Images</span> <span class=caption-body>The earth surrounding Fly Geyser at sunset.</span><span class=credit>Ryland West/Getty Images</span> <span class=caption-body>Fly Geyser's brilliant reds and greens.</span><span class=credit>Bernie Friel/Getty Images</span> <span class=caption-body>Fly Geyser, a happy accident in Nevada's desert.</span><span class=credit>Public Domain</span> <span class=caption-body>Fly Geyser spewing water from three spouts.</span><span class=credit>Jeff Foott/Getty Images</span> <span class=caption-body>A small rainbow of color in the mist coming from Fly Geyser.</span><span class=credit>Ken Lund/Wikimedia Commons</span><p class=social-callout>Like this gallery?<br>Share it:</p><img decoding=async alt="Fly Geyser From A Distance" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img///allthatsinteresting.com/thumb/630.501.allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/fly-geyser-from-a-distance.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> Welcome To Fly Geyser, The Surreal Landmark Just Outside Nevada’s Black Rock Desert View Gallery<h2>How Digging A Well Led To Fly Geyser's Formation</h2><p>In 1916, residents seeking irrigation to make the desert suitable for farming attempted to build themselves a well. They gave up, however, when they realized the water was far too hot — boiling, in fact.</p><p>According to the <a href=# rel=noopener>Reno Tahoe eNews</a>, this is when the property's first geyser, The Wizard, began to develop, but it wouldn't be until 1964 that the main geyser would form in a similarly accidental fashion.</p><p>That year, a geothermal power company drilled its own test well at Fly Ranch, but apparently, they failed to seal the hole off properly.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-419783 alt="Geyser At Fly Ranch" width=900 height=599 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/geyser-at-fly-ranch.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-419783 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Dukas/Universal Images Group via Getty Images</span><span class=caption-body>Fly Geyser has a uniquely large amount of quartz, which typically only forms in geysers that are around 10,000 years old.</span></p><p>It's unclear whether this was because they simply left it open or didn't plug it well enough, but regardless, boiling water soon burst from the hole, starting the formation of calcium carbonate deposits.</p><p>Over the decades, these deposits have continued to build, eventually turning into the three massive, cone-shaped mounds that now form the Fly Geyser. Today, the cones stand about twelve feet wide and six feet tall atop a massive mound and spit water an additional five feet in the air.</p><p>Then, in 2006, a third geyser known as Will's Geyser was discovered in the area, though it's believed Will's Geyser developed naturally. But while the Fly Ranch is a site filled with natural and manmade wonders, the public was unable to access them for years.</p><h2>How The Burning Man Project Is Making It Safe To Visit Fly Geyser</h2><p>For a time, access to Fly Geyser was limited. It sat on private land, and remained closed to the public for nearly two decades between the mid-1990s and 2016. That year, however, the land was acquired by the non-profit Burning Man Project, which has worked to revitalize the region and make it open to visitors.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Local public radio station KUNR</a> reported on the geyser following its reopening, with writer Bree Zender describing it as "the weirdest thing I've seen in my life — not just in geyser terms... The weirdest thing I've ever seen."</p><p>By the time the public could visit Fly Geyser in 2018, the entire formation had grown to be about 25 or 30 feet tall, which only accentuated the strange, alien-like appearance of its multicolored cones.</p><p>But making it safe and accessible hasn't been an entirely straightforward task, especially considering that some pools of water at the ranch can reach 200 degrees Fahrenheit. And in addition to Fly Geyser, Fly Ranch has multiple smaller geysers, hot springs, and wetlands, all of which make the region a unique challenge for the Burning Man Project.</p><p>"You know, we need to be mindful of where we walk. We are going to be taking a lot of game trails," said Burning Man's Zac Cirivello. "Trails that already exist. We don't want to carve new roads or seriously impair things."</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-419782 alt="Fly Ranch Geyser" width=900 height=600 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/fly-ranch-geyser.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-419782 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Christie Hemm Klok for The Washington Post via Getty Images</span><span class=caption-body>Fly Geyser was opened for visits in 2018, and the Burning Man Project continues to develop the site into a safe area for visitors.</span></p><p>Thankfully, improved accessibility has also allowed researchers to study Fly Geyser — and they've made some fascinating discoveries.</p><p>One researcher, Carolina Muñoz Saez, told KUNR, "I took some water samples to analyze the origin of the water."</p><p>Through this analysis, Muñoz Saez found that the inside of Fly Geyser is lined with a fair amount of quartz, which is more common in older geysers — 10,000 or so years older, in fact. Given that Fly Geyser is just over 60 years old, the formation of quartz in this instance is rather surprising.</p><p>But there's a reason, of course, that the quartz formed. As Muñoz Saez explained, the region has "a really high amount of silica," which, when combined with the heat of the water, makes quartz.</p><p>Today, Fly Geyser is open to visitors on a reservation-only basis. Tourists and locals curious about this strange wonder can book nature walks operated by <a href=# rel=noopener>Friends of Black Rock-High Rock</a>, on which they'll get to see Fly Geyser and the park's other geothermal marvels.</p><p>"To me on a personal level, the geyser represents constant change," Cirivello said. "It represents a sense of being literally connected deep into the earth. I wouldn't have thought something like this could exist until I saw it. And so it begs the question, what else is possible that we haven't necessarily considered?"</p><p>After learning about this odd man-made wonder, check out Ireland's most majestic attraction: <a href=#>the Cliffs of Moher</a>.
