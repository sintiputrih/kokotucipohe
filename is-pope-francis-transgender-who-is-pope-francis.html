He promoted humility, mercy, and concern for the underprivileged as the first pope to come from the Americas, the Southern Hemisphere, or the Society of Jesus (Jesuits).</p><p>The Vatican announced that transgender Catholics can be baptized, godparents, and witnesses at Catholic weddings in a document that Pope Francis has approved.

Pope Francis, who is known for his less formal style of pontificate, lives simply and resides in the guesthouse Domus Sanctae Marthae.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who is Pope Francis?</h2><p>The leader of the Catholic Church, the bishop of Rome, and the ruler of the Vatican City State is Pope Francis, whose birth name is Jorge Mario Bergoglio; born on December 17, 1936. Since the Syrian Pope Gregory III’s pontificate in the eighth century, Francis has been the first pope to be born or raised outside of Europe, the first pope from the Americas, the first from the Southern Hemisphere, and the first member of the Society of Jesus (Jesuits).</p><p>Born in Argentina’s Buenos Aires, Bergoglio first worked as a janitor and bouncer before pursuing chemistry training and becoming a technician in a food science lab. In 1958, following his convalescence from a severe bout of pneumonia and cysts, he felt moved to become a Jesuit.</p><p>He was consecrated as a Catholic priest in 1969 and served as Argentina’s Jesuit provincial superior from 1973 to 1979. In 1998, he was appointed Archbishop of Buenos Aires, and in 2001, Pope John Paul II made him a cardinal. During Argentina’s riots in December 2001, he served as the head of the Argentine Church.</p><p>He was viewed as a political rival by both the Kirchner and Fernández de Kirchner administrations. After Pope Benedict XVI resigned on February 28, 2013, Bergoglio was chosen as his successor on March 13 by a papal conclave. To honor Saint Francis of Assisi, he decided to take the name Francis as his papal name.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Francis has received recognition for his humility, focus on God’s mercy, global prominence as pope, care for the underprivileged, and dedication to interfaith dialogue throughout his public life. Compared to his predecessors, he is recognized for adopting a less formal style of pontificate. One example of this is his decision to live in the Domus Sanctae Marthae guesthouse instead of the papal apartments of the Apostolic Palace.</p><p>In the Roman Curia, Francis granted women full membership in dicasteries. He argues that the Catholic Church ought to speak out against the criminalization of homosexuality and show greater compassion for the LGBT community. Francis is a critic of unchecked capitalism, consumerism, and overdevelopment. He also supports action on climate change, which is a major area of focus for his pontificate.</p><p>Abolition of the death penalty is the Church’s commitment, as he stated that there can be “no going back from this position.” He has been widely understood to condemn the death penalty as inherently evil, calling it “an attack on the inviolability and dignity of the person” and “inadmissible.”</p><p>In the realm of international diplomacy, he played a key role in reestablishing full diplomatic ties between the US and Cuba, reaching an agreement with China regarding the extent of the Communist Party’s power to choose Chinese bishops, and advocating for increased immigration from the West during the refugee crises in Europe and Central America. He issued an apology in 2022 for the Church’s part in the “cultural genocide” of the indigenous peoples of Canada.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Pope Francis Early Life</h2><p>Jorge Mario Bergoglio was born on December 17, 1936 in the Buenos Aires neighborhood of Flores. Of Mario José Bergoglio’s (1908–1959) and Regina María Sívori’s (1911–1981) five children, he was the oldest. Italian immigrant accountant Mario Bergoglio[16] was born in the Piedmont region of Italy in Portacomaro (Province of Asti). Born in Buenos Aires, Regina Sívori was a housewife from a family of Piedmontese-Genoese (a region of northern Italy) descent. In 1929, Mario José’s family departed Italy in order to flee Benito Mussolini’s fascist rule.</p><p>The pope’s only surviving sibling, María Elena Bergoglio (born 1948), claims they did not leave for financial reasons. Marta Regina (1940–2007), Oscar Adrián (1938–deceased), and Alberto Horacio (1942–2010) were his other siblings. Antonio and Joseph, two great-nephews, lost their lives in a car accident. Cristina Bergoglio, his niece, is a Madrid, Spain-based painter.</p><p>Bergoglio went to Wilfrid Barón de los Santos Ángeles, a Salesians of Don Bosco school in Ramos Mejía, Province of Buenos Aires, for his sixth grade education. He was a student at Escuela Técnica Industrial N° 27, a technical secondary school. Named after a former Argentine president, Hipólito Yrigoyen [29] earned a diploma as a chemical technician.</p><p>In that role, he worked under Esther Ballestrino for a number of years in the food division of Hickethier-Bachmann Laboratory. Bergoglio had previously held positions as a floor sweeper and a bar bouncer in addition to his current position as a chemical technician.</p><p>He had three cysts and a potentially fatal case of pneumonia when he was 21 years old. Soon after, part of his lung was removed. Bergoglio has always been a fan of the football team San Lorenzo de Almagro. Bergoglio also enjoys tango dancing, neorealism, and Tita Merello films. He also has a soft spot for milongas, which are traditional songs from Uruguay and Argentina.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Pope Francis Writings</h2><p>Books and encyclicals are among the literary works to which Pope Francis has contributed. His writings on a variety of subjects express his views on societal issues, faith, and mercy. Apart from his writings, he also launched a unique project called “Wake Up!” in 2015, which included rock music and speeches by Pope Francis.</p><p>Regarding film, Pope Francis’ life has been portrayed in a number of movies. Among the noteworthy documentaries is Wim Wenders’ “Pope Francis: A Man of His Word,” which made its world premiere at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival.</p><p>2020 saw the release of “Francesco,” another documentary under the direction of Evgeny Afineevsky. In addition, the way Jonathan Pryce plays Pope Francis in the 2019 movie “The Two Popes” gives his life narrative a more cinematic touch. These varied platforms highlight the messages of Pope Francis’s multifarious influence on both written and visual platforms.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Pope Francis Age</h2><p>Born on December 17, 1936, Pope Francis is 86 years</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Is Pope Francis Transgender – FAQs</h2><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Is Pope Francis transgender?</h2><p>No, Pope Francis is not transgender.
