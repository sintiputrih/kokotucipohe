No cause of death has been officially released, but it was reported in 2021 that Terry had been diagnosed with dementia. It's unclear whether that was related to his death. The WWE also released a full obituary that confirmed Terry's passing.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>"Revered by fans and peers across the globe for his tenacity, heart and longevity, Funk will be remembered as one of the toughest competitors to ever step inside the squared circle," the obituary says.
