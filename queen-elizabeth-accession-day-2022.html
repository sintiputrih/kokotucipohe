Seventeen years later, the Queen has now shared a message for her Platinum Jubilee expressing her "sincere wish" for Camilla to be known as Queen when Charles takes to the throne.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In a poignant letter released the night before the anniversary of her accession to the throne on February 6, Queen Elizabeth asked the public to support her desire for the Duchess of Cornwall to become Charles' Queen Consort.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Unambiguously paving the way for Queen Camilla, she wrote, "And when, in the fullness of time, my son Charles becomes King, I know you will give him and his wife Camilla the same support that you have given me; and it is my sincere wish that, when that time comes, Camilla will be known as Queen Consort as she continues her own loyal service."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Shortly after the letter was released, a Clarence House spokesperson told <a href=# data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://Bazaar.com&source=gmail&ust=1644244399744000&usg=AOvVaw2HfLINyPh8aUeM6WEFH7Na" data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://bazaar.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Bazaar.com class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Bazaar.com</a> that Prince Charles and the duchess were both "touched and honored by Her Majesty's words." And the Prince of Wales followed with an official response on Sunday morning, writing in a letter that both her and Camilla are "deeply conscious of the honour represented by my mother's wish."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">He added, "As we have sought together to serve and support Her Majesty and the people of our communities, my darling wife has been my own steadfast support throughout."<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It’s long been reported that Camilla always hoped to one day serve as Queen next to King Charles, but polls on her popularity in the U.K. have always been less than favourable. In May 2021, a YouGov <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.newsweek.com/2021/12/10/prince-charles-wants-camilla-queen-against-wishes-his-sons-subjects-1652102.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=survey class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">survey</a> revealed that just 13% of the British public believe Camilla should be titled "Queen," with 41% opting for the lesser title of "Princess Consort." It is now hoped that with Queen Elizabeth's pledge of support, things might change.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">To mark Accession Day itself, Buckingham Palace released a new portrait of the monarch—now the longest serving in British history—taken in the Saloon at Sandringham House with one of her famous red despatch boxes. Every day the container is filled with documents updating the Queen on matters of Parliament, the Commonwealth and events around the world, as well as official papers requiring her signature or response.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The Queen’s February 5 letter—which she hand-signed "Your servant, Elizabeth"—also shared Her Majesty’s praise for husband Prince Philip’s role as loyal consort during her reign until he passed away last year. "I was blessed that in Prince Philip I had a partner willing to carry out the role of consort and unselfishly make the sacrifices that go with it," she said. "It is a role I saw my own mother perform during my father’s reign."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In a nod to the vow of public service she made at just 21-years-old, two months after her father King George VI passed away on February 6, 1952, the Queen also re-pledged that her "life will always be devoted to your service."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Read the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee letter in full:</strong></p>Tomorrow, 6th February, marks the 70th anniversary of my Accession in 1952. It is a day that, even after 70 years, I still remember as much for the death of my father, King George VI, as for the start of my reign.As we mark this anniversary, it gives me pleasure to renew to you the pledge I gave in 1947 that my life will always be devoted to your service.As I look ahead with a sense of hope and optimism to the year of my Platinum Jubilee, I am reminded of how much we can be thankful for. These last seven decades have seen extraordinary progress socially, technologically and culturally that have benefitted us all; and I am confident that the future will offer similar opportunities to us and especially to the younger generations in the United Kingdom and throughout the Commonwealth.I am fortunate to have had the steadfast and loving support of my family.I was blessed that in Prince Philip I had a partner willing to carry out the role of consort and unselfishly make the sacrifices that go with it. It is a role I saw my own mother perform during my father’s reign.This anniversary also affords me a time to reflect on the goodwill shown to me by people of all nationalities, faiths and ages in this country and around the world over these years. I would like to express my thanks to you all for your support. I remain eternally grateful for, and humbled by, the loyalty and affection that you continue to give me. And when, in the fullness of time, my son Charles becomes King, I know you will give him and his wife Camilla the same support that you have given me; and it is my sincere wish that, when that time comes, Camilla will be known as Queen Consort as she continues her own loyal service.And so as I look forward to continuing to serve you with all my heart, I hope this Jubilee will bring together families and friends, neighbours and communities – after some difficult times for so many of us – in order to enjoy the celebrations and to reflect on the positive developments in our day-to-day lives that have so happily coincided with my reign.Your ServantELIZABETH R.<strong></strong><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/45770d72-fac8-4474-90bb-36e121ad9a67_1543445615.jpeg alt="Headshot of Omid Scobie" title="Headshot of Omid Scobie" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Omid Scobie is <a href=#>BAZAAR.com</a>’s Royal Editor at Large and has covered the lives and philanthropic work of the younger members of the British Royal Family for over eight years.
