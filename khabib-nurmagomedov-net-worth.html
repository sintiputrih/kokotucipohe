But it is not named after Khabib but his uncle Nurmagomed Nurmagomedov. His uncle was a sambo world champion in the 90s.</p><p>The house Khabib lives in is no different from any other village house.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Khabib-In-His-House.jpg><p>The only different and additional feature of the house the separates the house from the rest is the view from the window, which overlooks the beautiful mountains.</p><p>The house has two small rooms with a couch and beds. Other than that, it has a pantry with an old refrigerator and a small kitchen area.</p><h4>Apartment in San Jose, California</h4><p>Khabib basically lives in two countries. One in Russia, where he lives with his wife and children, and another in San Jose, where he trains at American Kickboxing Academy.</p><p>But very little is known about the fighter’s apartment in San Jose.</p><h3>Cars</h3><p>Even though only a little information about his house is available, we sure know what type of whips the fighter owns. Let’s get it done with then, shall we?</p><h4>Lada Prioral</h4><p>This was Khabib’s first car he ever bought after getting his driving license in his Russian homeland of Dagestan.</p><p>He bought the car for well over $2,700. It had a 1.6 liters 4 inline 98 horsepower engine.</p><p>The car was not known for its speed, but it certainly was reliable.</p><p>However, the fighter had to sell the car to fund his MMA career, and it sounds like it’s worth it.</p><p>This was his first car but not the last.</p><h4>Mercedes-Benz W124 300E</h4><p>Khabib always wanted to own a Mercedes-Benz. It was like his dream car.</p><p>When the fighter started making money, he purchased this Mercedes-Benz W124 300E. The car is now worth around $6,900 used.</p><p>This particular model of Benz was launched in 1987. It has a 178 brake horsepower engine that pumps the top speed of 135 miles an hour.</p><p>He still owns this Mercedes even though he got into an accident on it.</p><h4>Mercedes-Benz AMG-GT</h4><p>After Khabib started making a name for himself and his country, he made some high-class people happy to put the country on the map in MMA.</p><p>With such happy people, Khabib didn’t even have to pay for this Benz.</p><p>One of the Russian billionaires was so happy that he gifted Mercedes-Benz AMG-GT to Khabib.</p><p>The car comes equipped with a Twin-Turbocharged V8 engine.</p><p>It costs about $190,000 brand new.</p><p>However, it seems like Khabib and Mercedes don’t go together. One of his friends borrowed the car and smacked it into the pole.</p><h4>Ferrari California</h4><p>It’s like every sports athlete one day wants his hands on the steering wheel of Ferrari.</p><p>“And the world shall know that he made it.”</p><p>Khabib has been spotted frequently behind the wheel of Ferrari California. The car costs around $200,000.</p><p>However, it is not clear that if he owns or rents it.</p><p>The car has a top speed of 193 miles an hour and can go from 0-60 miles an hour in just 4 seconds.</p><h4>BMW 6 Series</h4><p>When the fighter’s career really took off, he invested in a couple of BMW 6 series runners.</p><p>The cost of the 6 series starts at around $60,000.</p><p>Series 6 was launched by BMW in 2004; however, they stopped selling them in 2018.</p><p>It is unknown that which model the fighter owns.</p><p>Reportedly, newly purchased two BMW 6 series in a year.</p><h4>Toyota Land Cruiser J200</h4><p>It is believed to be the most recent purchase of Khabib. He added the beast SUV Land Cruiser J200 to his garage.</p><p>The SUV costs a little over $85,000 brand new.</p><p>It makes sense because Toyota was the sponsor in a few of Khabibs’ fights.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Khabib-Land-Cruiser.jpg><p>Land Cruiser is Toyota’s most popular and longest-running series.</p><p>The SUV comes equipped with a 4.0-liter V6 engine that pumps 245 bake horsepower.</p><p>Suitable for all terrains, it is the vehicle of choice of United Nations and NATO forces.</p><p><strong>Read About: <a href=# rel=noopener>Jay Leno’s Cars and Net Worth</a></strong></p><h2>Lifestyle</h2><p>The undefeated Eagle lives a luxurious lifestyle with his wife and children.</p><p>As we already know that he owns a couple of houses and a fleet of cars.</p><p>With a net worth as much as $40 million, he can live a lavish life without having to lift a finger ever in his life.</p><p>He has made some savvy business investments for passive income.</p><p>As a world-renowned athlete, we know for sure that he spends most of his mornings in the gym.</p><p>Even though he is retired, he still has to maintain his fitness level for endorsements and television appearances.</p><p>Khabib’s workout schedule’s like</p><ul><li>Running-&nbsp;90 minutes in the morning/daily</li><li>Martial Arts Training-&nbsp;Afternoons/daily</li><li>Grappling/Sparring-&nbsp;Evenings/daily</li><li>Russian Sauna-&nbsp;Once per week</li></ul><p>If you are a fan of Khabib, you might have seen him in a big furry hat, but do you know why he wears it?</p><p>Well, the hat is known as a Papakha and is traditionally worn by men throughout the Caucasus.</p><p>Khabib wears it as a tribute to his Avar roots. The hat is made up of sheep’s skin and wool with basic rope adjustments.</p><p>As for vacations, Khabib does a lot of traveling for his work.</p><p>He has been spotted in a couple of places, such as the UAE and Paris.</p><h2>Charity</h2><p>Khabib really loves giving back to society. Though he is at the top of the world now, he has not forgotten his roots and knows what it feels like to not have something.</p><p>Khabib reportedly donated $100,000 to Dustin Poirier’s, with UFC president Dana White matching his donations.</p><p>Following his retirement, the fighter has been involved in numerous charity and social works.</p><p>Khabib is very closely involved in a charity drug rehabilitation center alongside his training partner Magomedzaid Zaidov.</p><h2>Media, Endorsement, and Investments</h2><h3>Media</h3><p>Khabib has made some screen appearances, including documentaries and series.</p><p>He is mostly known for his appearances in 2019 Rivals, 2018 UFC Bad Blood, 2012-2104 UFC on Fox, and 2016 TV miniseries UFC 200 Greatest Fighters of All Time.</p><h3>Endorsements</h3><p>Khabib has endorsed a handful of big brands, which ultimately earned him millions.</p><p>He scored endorsement deals with Reebok and Toyota, which made him over $1.5 million.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Khabib.jpg><p>Similarly, the fighter also co-founded martial arts center Eagles MMA and gets paid to give master classes and lectures to young wannabe MMA fighters.</p><h3>Investments</h3><p>Back in 2020, Khabib launched his own MMA promotion company named Eagle Fighting Championship.</p><p>Similarly, he has his own line of clothing, which was launched in 2017.</p><h2>Career</h2><p>Khabib’s career in MMA started in 2008 when he competed in Russia.</p><p>He generated 16-0 records in countries including Ukraine and Russia, and later in 2011, he moved to the Ultimate Fighting Championship.</p><p>His big debut in UFC was in 2012 against Kamal Shalorus.</p><p>After winning the debut fight, he was unstoppable. He went on defeating players like Thiago Tavares, Abel Trujillo and Gleison Tibau.</p><p>He defeated them mostly in technical knockouts and submissions.</p><p>Khabib has successfully defended his title throughout his career against fighters like Connor McGregor, Justin Gaethje, and Dustin Poirier.</p><p>In 2020 Khabib retired.</p><p>However, he never faced Tony Ferguson, who is another Lightweight title contender.</p><p>Despite his humble attitude, he has been into numerous controversies over the years.</p><p>After winning the match against the notorious McGregor in 2018, Khabib jumped over the octagon and assaulted Connor’s cornerman, Dillon Danis, leading to big chaos and fight.</p><p>After the chaos settled, the payment for the match was withheld and only released after Khabib paid the fine of $500,000.
