If you follow what Purah recommends after the first few main quests and head northwest toward Rito Village, you should stumble upon Hestu soon enough. He is <b>halfway up the hill that Lindor’s Brow Skyview Tower sits atop</b>.</p><h2>Where is Hestu located?</h2><p>Hestu will be waiting just northeast of Riverside Stable, north of Owlan Bridge. You can easily find him by just following the Hylia River on its left bank from Lake Hylia, past Proxim Bridge, north.</p><h2>Where is Tork Hestu’s second location?</h2><p>Check under the tree to the right of the item shop in Lookout Landing for Hestu’s second location, but you might need to progress the main story. The next location you’ll find Hestu is none other than Lookout Landing, the first settlement you’ll visit on your trip through Hyrule.</p><h2>Where is Hestu in Tears of the Kingdom?</h2><p>Where is Hestu? Hestu can be found to the northwest of Lookout Landing. You’ll need to cross Carok Bridge to reach a new section of the map, which you can only uncover after finding Lindor’s Brow Skyview Tower.</p><h2>What are the coordinates for Hetsu Totk?</h2><p>Hestu can be found northwest of Lookout Landing, near Lindor’s Brow. His exact positioning is southeast of the area’s Skyview Tower, at these coordinates: -1714, 1067, 0202. He will appear to be scared, cowering in fear until Link comes to speak to him.</p><h2>Zelda Tears Of The Kingdom All 1000 Korok Locations</h2><h2>Why isn t Hestu appearing?</h2><p>If Hestu isn’t in Lookout Landing, it means that he’s moved to the Korok Forest in Tears of the Kingdom. In fact, the player’s own actions will actually trigger his relocation, whether it’s knowingly or unknowingly.</p><h2>Why isn t Hestu appearing in Tears of the Kingdom?</h2><p>Once Link has cleared the Gloom out of the Korok Forest, he’ll be able to find Hestu there for the remainder of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.</p><h2>Where can I find Hestu again?</h2><p>After completing the Deku Tree side quest, Hestu will stay put in the Lost Woods area of Hyrule. This is where he will be staying, and he will once again be happy to trade seeds for cache expansions.</p><h2>Where is Korok seed guy Tork?</h2><p>If you mean Hestu (who uses korok seeds for unlocking inventory space), Hestu’s first location is due northwest of the New Serenne Stable (near Impa’s first quest), he is between the stable and that region’s Skyview Tower. So starting from the stable, if you chart a straight line northwest you should find him.</p><h2>What is the reward of Korok Seeds in Totok?</h2><p>Having more inventory space for weapons, shields, and bows comes in very handy, particularly with the unfortunate weapon durability issue. Once determined players find every single one of the 1,000 Korok Seeds in Tears of the Kingdom and bring them to Hestu, they’ll receive Hestu’s Gift: another pile of golden poo.</p><h2>How many Korok Seeds are there in Totk?</h2><p>There are 1,000 Korok seeds in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. In comparison to Breath of the Wild, which featured a paltry 900 seeds, there are 100 extra Korok poops to find. Of course, the locations are all different.</p><h2>Where did Hestu go in Zelda?</h2><p>Once you have access to Korok Forest, Hestu will relocate to his home, meaning you’ll need to visit the Korok Forest in the Lost Woods (or just warp to the Forest using Musanokir Shrine) to upgrade your inventory.</p><h2>Why is Hetsu so big?</h2><p>None of this is ever given any explanation. There’s no side quest to uncover why Hestu has grown to such a large size, no Koroks express regret at stealing his maraca’s seeds if you collect a set amount of them. It’s just this sort of nebulous thing that exists in the game that we’re not really meant to question.</p><h2>Where do I exchange Korok Seeds in Tears of the Kingdom?</h2><p>Following your first encounter, Hestu takes up residence in the main square of Lookout Landing in the middle of Hyrule Field. Speak to him there whenever you have leftover Korok Seeds to expand your inventory size and hoard more weapons, bows and shields!</p><h2>Do Korok Seeds turn in in Tears of the Kingdom?</h2><p>Korok Seeds are needed to turn in to Hestu to expand your inventory storage for weapons, bows, and shields. Check out our interactive map of Hyrule in Tears of the Kingdom to find them all.</p><h2>Does Hestu move?</h2><p>Finding Hestu</p><p>He’ll stay here until you upgrade your inventory twice. From there, he’ll move to the Riverside Stable. This stable is straight west of Kakariko Village next to Wahgo Katta shrine. After six more upgrades, Hestu will move to his final location.</p><h2>What do you do with Korok Seeds in Totk?</h2><p>I’ve been playing for 10-15hrs and still couldn’t find anyone that’ll accept them. As in BotW, Korok Seeds are used to unlock more inventory space for weapons and shields. You need to visit a specific NPC called Hestu who accepts Korok Seeds in exchange for the inventory space.</p><h2>Does Hestu stay at Lookout Landing?</h2><p>Travel back to Lookout Landing, and you’ll find Hestu standing near the settlement’s southern gate. Hestu remains in Lookout Landing until you remove the Gloom from Korok Forest, so you can just fast travel back to the town as soon as he leaves.</p><h2>Has anyone found all Korok Seeds?</h2><p>In The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, truly ambitious collectors managed to find 900 Korok seeds hidden all across Hyrule. In Tears of the Kingdom, there are even more: 1000. And unfortunately, the reward for finding them all is just as disgusting as it was in the previous game.</p><h2>Where is Hestu after you talk to him?</h2><p>To find Hestu in Zelda Tears of the Kingdom, you need to go to one of three locations, as Hestu moves after you interact with him a certain amount of times, shifting from the wild to Lookout Landing and finally arriving at the foot of the Great Deku Tree.</p><h2>Do I need to collect all 900 Korok Seeds?</h2><p>As mentioned before, you need to collect all 900 Korok Seeds in order to earn Hestu’s Gift. Though this item is relatively useless, you at least have the benefit of earning the inventory expansion that turning in the Korok Seeds to Hestu grants you. See All Korok Seed Locations.</p><h2>Should I give Korok Seeds to Hestu?</h2><p>Collecting these items is vitally important to improving the player’s experience on their journey. Korok Seeds can be given to Hestu to expand Link’s inventory, in turn, allowing more bows, shields, and weapons to be held at one time.</p><h2>What happens if you miss Hestu?</h2><p>In short, if players can’t find Hestu in Lookout Landing, they should look for him in Korok Forest. While the giant, maraca-playing Korok may be frustratingly elusive and vague at times, it’s worth seeking him out – if not for Hestu’s Gift, then for a simple inventory upgrade or two.</p><h2>What happens when you get all 999 Korok Seeds?</h2><p>In exchange for Korok Seeds, Hestu will add one slot to Link’s Weapon, Bow, or Shield stashes. Link can fully upgrade his inventory with only 441 Korok Seeds. If all 900 Seeds are returned to Hestu, he will reward Link with a “gift of friendship.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r6%2FErJpnm5%2BifKitzKKloGWWlr5ww8eeqZ5lmah6qbHSraxmoZ5iwbDAzqRm</p></div><div id=links><a href=./who-is-stephanie-halcro-know-her-age-and-bio-meet-her-on-instagram.html>&#171;&nbsp;Who Is Stephanie Halcro?
