The unexpected death of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lisa Marie Presley</a> due to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">cardiac arrest </a>on Jan. 12, 2023, has allowed people to revisit another tragic death in the family. We are talking of death by suicide of Lisa’s son, Benjamin Keough.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=239 data-current-count=239 data-injectable=false>Born on Oct. 21, 1992, in Tampa, Florida, Benjamin Keough was the youngest child of Lisa Marie Presley and Danny Keough, a touring musician for the iconic jazz musician Chick Corea who was also an independent professional in his own right.</p><p data-characters=546 data-current-count=785 data-injectable=true>Given his immensely popular family, it is apparent that Keough was raised in wealth and luxury. His mother is the only child of Elvis Presley and an heir to $100 million. He has an elder sister named <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Riley Keough</a>, who is a well-known actress and filmmaker. He also has two half-sisters from his mom’s side, Finley and Harper Lockwood, daughters of Lisa and her husband Michael Lockwood, whom she married in 2006. Benjamin attracted quite a lot of media and public attention for his striking resemblance to his iconic grandfather, Elvis Presley.</p><p data-characters=782 data-current-count=782 data-injectable=true>In a few of his public appearances, the similarity was noticed and commented upon. Even his mother claimed to have been taken aback and mentioned that she was “overwhelmed” by the resemblance as she felt like she was looking at her father. At 17, Benjamin attempted to extend the likeness that he shared with his grandfather by following a similar career path. He signed a $5 million contract with Universal to produce five albums. Even though he was believed to go to the studio for recording songs, his music was never officially released. The pressure of living up to his family name and legacy and his relatively less successful career in music reportedly resulted in addiction and depression causing him to die by suicide in 2020. Let’s dive into the details of the same.</p><h2 id=h-how-and-when-did-benjamin-keough-die data-injectable=false><strong>How and when did Benjamin Keough die?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Benjamin-Keough.jpg><p data-characters=313 data-current-count=613 data-injectable=true>Benjamin’s passing led to several questions regarding the cause of his death. He was reportedly suffering from depression. His representative spoke in detail about the subject and said that ten years before the incident, he showed different signs of depression such as waking up at midday and fluctuating moods.</p><p data-characters=293 data-current-count=293 data-injectable=false>It was also reported that he spent a significant amount of time at a rehabilitation facility trying to get cured of his alcohol and drug addiction. Reports also claimed that on the day of his death, he was at a joint party with his brother-in-law Ben-Smith Peterson and girlfriend Diana Pinto.</p><p data-characters=310 data-current-count=603 data-injectable=true>While initial reports suggested that he shot himself in the chest, it was confirmed that he shot himself in the mouth. People and neighbors mentioned having heard the words “Don’t do it” before hearing a gunshot. Later, he was laid to rest alongside his grandfather at the Meditation Garden at Graceland.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Reactions to his death</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Benjamin-Keough-and-Brandon-Howard.jpg><p data-characters=316 data-current-count=616 data-injectable=true>Benjamin’s death deeply affected his friends and family, especially his mother Lisa, who claimed to have shared a very close bond with her son. Words of condolences poured from every source and one of the figures that came forward and talked about Benjamin and his death was his friend and musician Brandon Howard.</p><p data-characters=462 data-current-count=462 data-injectable=true>Howard met him after his mother Lisa married the pop megastar <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Michael Jackson </a>in 1994 as Jackson’s father Joe served as the manager of Brandon’s mother, Miki Howard. Howard and Benjamin remained in contact even after Presley and Jackson split in 1996. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking on the subject of his death</a>, Howard told People that the constant struggle to live up to the Presley name contributed to his depression eventually leading to the decision to die. He went on to say:</p><p>“As adults, we had a brotherhood and a kind of respect. We always felt we are who we are and we just got to be the best we can for different people around us. He would be the one I talked to when a lot of stuff was going around about me and questions about who I am and where I come from. He was like, ‘Who does that serve? Does that serve you or does that serve everyone else’s purpose?’ You are who you are, I am who I am. So it’s up to us. We don’t have anything to prove. We just live our lives. Those who know it, they know. He was super inspiring. He was cool and very intelligent, intelligent beyond his years. He was multi-faceted. He could be anywhere from serious, giving advice, to like super crazy and wild and dancing and partying. He was a very loving person as a brother. He had the craziest laugh. I want people to know about his humility. He wasn’t a spoiled kid. He was very humble, very giving, very loving, especially to his friends. It’s just wild. There’s nothing like this.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Trev Lukather (@trevlukather)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=133 data-current-count=433 data-injectable=true>Musician Trev Lukather also took to Instagram to post his condolences where he mentioned to have missed Benjamin every day.
