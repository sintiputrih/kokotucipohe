During the time Suplee was part of the cast of <i>My Name Is Earl</i>, a show that had several individuals involved with Scientology, there were reports indicating his membership in the organization. However, Suplee has maintained a low profile about his religious beliefs and has not publicly discussed the extent of his involvement or whether he remains a Scientologist today.</p><h3 class=article_sub_title>Mimi Rogers</h3><img alt="test article image" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/media-proxy.curioushistorian.com/width/800?url=media.curioushistorian.com/images/d75832577a9107e0a6b40d4f0e7c119f.jpg"> <span class=img_cap_wrap>(getty images)</span><p>Mimi Rogers, an actress, has had a significant connection to the Church of Scientology. Her father became interested in Dianetics, the foundational text of Scientology, in 1952 and went on to become a prominent Mission Holder within the church. Rogers herself reportedly became a highly trained "auditor," a role involved in the practice of Dianetics, within the church. Prior to her acting career, she co-founded the Enhancement Center, a "field auditing" practice, with her first husband, Jim Rogers. Notably, Rogers served as Sonny Bono's "auditor" for Dianetics, and Tom Cruise was also a client before being directed to a Celebrity Center within the church. However, Rogers has since left the Church of Scientology and has been referred to as a former member. Media reports have suggested that <a href=#><b>she holds an unfavorable view</b></a> of the church's controversial leader, David Miscavige, indicating a significant shift in her stance and relationship with Scientology.</p><h3 class=article_sub_title>Neil Gaiman</h3><img alt="test article image" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/media-proxy.curioushistorian.com/width/800?url=media.curioushistorian.com/images/f9e6a991a41cf45c39eee8308896ff0c.jpg"> <span class=img_cap_wrap>(reddit)</span><p>Neil Gaiman, the acclaimed author known for works like <i>Good Omens</i> and <i>American Gods</i>, has had a connection to the Church of Scientology <a href=#><b>through his upbringing</b></a>.

His father served as the British spokesperson for Scientology, indicating a close association with the church. Reports have suggested that Gaiman's ex-wife and sisters are also members of the church, although this has not been confirmed. Despite his familial ties to Scientology, Gaiman has openly denied being a Scientologist, making it clear that he does not personally practice the religion. It appears that Gaiman was raised in an environment surrounded by Scientology, but his personal beliefs and affiliations are distinct from the church.</p><h3 class=article_sub_title>Nancy Cartwright</h3><img alt="test article image" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/media-proxy.curioushistorian.com/width/800?url=media.curioushistorian.com/images/e26a16637013d8dda86e22059dd941db.jpg"> <span class=img_cap_wrap>(getty images)</span><p>Nancy Cartwright, widely recognized as the voice of Bart Simpson, has had a notable and long-standing connection to the Church of Scientology.

However, Burroughs' initial fascination with Scientology eventually waned, leading to a sense of disillusionment.</p><p>In 1971, he published a book titled <i>Ali's Smile: Naked Scientology</i>, which openly criticized the church. In both the book and his public comments, Burroughs accused Scientology of utilizing authoritarian tactics to control its members and drew parallels between the church and the secretive operations of the CIA. These critical views reflected his personal experiences and observations, highlighting a significant shift in his perception of Scientology from initial engagement to subsequent skepticism.</p><h3 class=article_sub_title>Chick Corea</h3><img alt="test article image" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/media-proxy.curioushistorian.com/width/800?url=media.curioushistorian.com/images/35fa28cc81c2f10c1bd8342e46274d70.jpg"> <span class=img_cap_wrap>(getty images)</span><p><span>Chick Corea, a highly influential jazz musician, </span><a href=#><b>had a deep connection to the Church of Scientology</b></a><span>.

In October 1997, Presley, along with her friend and fellow Scientologist Isaac Hayes, opened the Literacy, Education, and Ability Program (LEAP).

However, Presley's relationship with Scientology eventually became strained.</span><br></p><p><span>By 2008, she began experiencing growing discontent with the organization. The turning point came in 1993 when Presley turned 25 and became eligible to receive her inheritance from her father's estate. At that time, Scientology's interest in her reportedly intensified, leading to a significant shift in their interactions. Ultimately, Presley made the decision to leave Scientology in 2014. Her departure marked a significant change in her connection to the church, fueled by her evolving dissatisfaction with the organization's involvement in her life and inheritance.&nbsp;</span><span><a href=#><b>She later recalled</b></a>:</span><br></p>At 25, after I got the inheritance, they started grooming me to be this person who would go out and get everyone else in.<h3 class=article_sub_title>Paul Haggis</h3><img alt="test article image" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/media-proxy.curioushistorian.com/width/800?url=media.curioushistorian.com/images/d6a1f831183c50a3443b145e7d9732e3.jpg"> <span class=img_cap_wrap>(getty images)</span><p>Paul Haggis, a prominent filmmaker, had a significant connection to the Church of Scientology for 35 years <a href=#><b>before leaving in October 2009</b></a>.

Haggis, who strongly disagreed with this stance, reached out to Tommy Davis, the Church's spokesperson, requesting a denouncement of these statements.</p><p>When Davis chose not to respond, Haggis expressed his disapproval, emphasizing that silence implies consent. He raised additional concerns, including Scientology's policy of disconnection and the unauthorized release of personal information about former members. Haggis' departure, along with that of actor Jason Beghe, created significant PR challenges for Scientology, as the organization heavily relies on Hollywood figures for both revenue and promotion.
