The Silent Sea (2021)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=579 data-current-count=879 data-injectable=true>This science fiction TV show sees a future version of planet Earth compromised by desertification.

With a healthy dose of thriller and mystery sewed into the story, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Silent Sea</a> makes for a compelling and intriguing watch.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>6. Seobok: Project Clone (2021)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=631 data-current-count=931 data-injectable=true>For fans of science fiction, Seobok: Project Clone hits the mark just as well as it does for those who enjoy philosophy.

Silenced (2011)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=566 data-current-count=866 data-injectable=true>Written and directed by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hwang Dong Hyuk</a> — the creator of Squid Game — Silenced portrays the atrocious crimes that went on at a school for hearing-impaired kids, who were repeatedly sexually abused by staff members over the years. Unfortunately, the film is based on real-life events, offering difficult-to-watch portrayals of sexual assault and its consequences. Raw and intense, Silenced had a significant cultural impact on South Korea, sparkling conversation about the country’s lenient laws regarding sexual crimes, and eventually leading to actual change.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>4. Guardian: The Lonely and Great God (2016-2017)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=577 data-current-count=877 data-injectable=true>Guardian: The Lonely and Great God — best known simply as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Goblin</a> — is one of the most beloved TV shows in South Korea by both critics and the general public.

As a charismatic salesman who entices down-on-their-luck folks to join the game, the actor had viewers wrapped around his finger.</p><h2 id=h-1-train-to-busan-2016 data-injectable=false>1. Train to Busan (2016)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=549 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=335 data-current-count=335 data-injectable=false>Many would consider <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Train to Busan</a> a masterclass in filmmaking — <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">and they would be right</a>. With a premise that could potentially make this just another apocalyptic thriller about zombies, Train to Busan manages to defy expectations by delivering some of the most heart-wrenching, bawl-your-eyes-out emotional moments in Korean cinema.</p><p data-characters=268 data-current-count=603 data-injectable=true>In the film, Gong Yoo plays Seok Woo, a divorced businessman who puts work above all else.
