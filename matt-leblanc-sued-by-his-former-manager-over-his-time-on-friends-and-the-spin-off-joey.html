One of them was with his own manager after it was deemed that the profits from his gigs weren't divided fairly.</p><p>We're going to reveal what went down, while also showcasing yet another lawsuit that took place, this one instead was for defamation.

He was on Friends for a decade, while he enjoyed two extra seasons on the spin-off, Joey.</p><p>Following Joey's cancelation, Matt LeBlanc decided to make a change. Instead of searching for the next project, he didn't want to know anything about Hollywood. In fact, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the actor wanted his agent to lose his number</a>. At that point, LeBlanc's only focus was to take time away. The actor didn't want a schedule and at the time he barely went out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He revealed, "For years and years, I barely left the house. I was burnt out. I wanted to not have a schedule, not be somewhere. I was in a position to do that. My agent was bummed. Most actors call their agents and say, ‘What’s going on?’. I’d call mine and say, ‘Please lose my number for a few years’. It was a very dark time. I almost had a nervous breakdown," LeBlanc tells CinemaBlend.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Matt LeBlanc Refused To Answer His Agent Once His Decade Long Run On Friends Came To An End</a></span></p><p>The actor ultimately made a return in a major way, appearing on the TV series Episodes, which was a major project while he also took on Top Gear. LeBlanc pounced when the moment was right and in truth, he had more than enough funds to take that time off. However, he did encounter some problems during that time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=camille-cerio-sued-matt-leblanc-over-breach-of-contract-over-her-commissions>Camille Cerio Sued Matt LeBlanc Over Breach Of Contract Over Her Commissions</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/matt-leblanc-looking-frustrated.jpg><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Camille Cerio, LeBlanc promised 15% of all his pilots</a>. When 2000 came around, those payments stopped taking place. LeBlanc denied the allegations, making the claim that he was paying the manager $200,000 in commissions.</p><p>Business Insider detailed both sides of the story.</p><p>The publication writes, "Former FRIENDS star MATT LeBLANC is heading to court after allegedly failing to pay his former business manager $1 million (GBP500,000). Camille Cerio is suing the actor for breach of contract and claims he owes her commission for managing his career."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"LeBlanc maintains he has paid Cerio more than $200,000 (GBP100,000) in payments, but in a lawsuit filed at Los Angeles Superior Court earlier this month (2Jul08), Cerio claims the amount is nothing compared to his royalties from Friends and spin-off Joey. Cerio claims that LeBlanc agreed to cut her 15 percent from all the pilots, but stopped paying her in 2000."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>The One Actor David Schwimmer Was Embarrassed To Shoot Scenes With On Friends</a></span></p><p>A court date was set for the fall of 2020. In terms of a verdict, it doesn't seem like anything came of it. Two things likely took place, either Cerio's evidence wasn't sufficient, which caused the case to collapse. Or, the lawsuit was taken care of outside of court, and LeBlanc's team paid the manager what was owed.</p><h2 id=matt-leblanc-was-also-sued-for-defamation-by-stephanie-stephens-over-comments-that-were-published-by-the-national-enquirer>Matt LeBlanc Was Also Sued For Defamation By Stephanie Stephens Over Comments That Were Published By The National Enquirer</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/instar43713857.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Years prior in 2006, LeBlanc faced yet another lawsuit, but this was for different reasons unrelated. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Stephanie Stephens stepped up and sued LeBlanc for defamation</a>. According to the lawsuit, LeBlanc had spread false news about Stephens to the National Enquirer.</p><p>"Stephanie Stephens claims in a lawsuit that LeBlanc told an unspecified person last August that she was sexually aggressive, gave him a lap dance in a private room and engaged him in a "night of sexual debauchery ... at her place of employment," Today writes.</p><p>Stephens completely denied the claims stating that she wasn't aggressive towards LeBlanc, and never gave the Friends star a lap dance at the time.</p><p>LeBlanc's team didn't comment on the matter and once again, the allegations disappeared without any type of public verdict. It is very possible that this lawsuit didn't get very far. Nonetheless, it was another headache for Matt and his team post-Friends.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>SOURCES - Today & Business Insider</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikmqykYrmmrsuapZxlo6qypXnBsmShoaNis7C%2BzJ6pZqWRo66osdFmpq%2BdomK1qr%2BMraCmnV2ku26y0aKcp5yjYq6vsIytn55lo6W2r3nOn51mop%2BaxnA%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./the-ultimate-guide-where-to-find-baseball-spring-training-in-arizona.html>&#171;&nbsp;The Ultimate Guide: Where to Find Baseball Spring Training in Arizona</a>
