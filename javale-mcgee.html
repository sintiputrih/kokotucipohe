JaVale McGee also was in the game of college basketball for the Nevada Wolf Pack.</span></h3><h2><span id=Early_Life_and_Childhood>Early Life and Childhood</span></h2><p>Javale McGee was born on <strong>January 19, 1988,</strong> and his birthplace is Flint, Michigan. He is an American by nationality. Likewise, his age is <strong>36 years old.</strong> There is no more information about his family, childhood, etc. Regarding JaVale McGee’s education, he previously joined 2 high schools in Michigan, Detroit Country Day School, and Providence Christian, before moving to Hales Franciscan High School, Chicago. In the Hales Franciscan coach Gary London’s opinion, McGee’s position in college was a little forward, and he could play 2 forward positions.</p><p>He was the beginning center for the University of Nevada. After McGee’s sophomore campaign, in which he scored 14.3 points and 7.3 rebounds, shooting 53% from the field and 33% from the three-point range, McGee decided to recruit an agent and announce for the 2008 NBA draft.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-94018 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/JaVale-McGee-with-his-mother-and-siblings.jpg alt="JaVale McGee" width=650 height=486 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-94018 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: JaVale McGee with his mother and siblings (Source: Instagram)</p><h2><span id=Career_and_Professional_Life>Career and Professional Life</span></h2><p>At first, JaVale was chosen eighteenth by the Wizards in the 2008 NBA draft. On July 9, 2008, he made a deal of 2 years, a $2.4 million contract with the Wizards. McGee had to give a fine of $10 K by the Wizards for taking part in Gilbert Arenas’ antics on January 9, 2010, before a match on January 5, 2010, in which the opposite team was the Philadelphia 76ers. On January 6, 2011, McGee again was able to take part in the 2011 NBA Slam Dunk Contest. McGee was the 1st Wizard to ever take part there. Unfortunately, he lost to&nbsp;Blake Griffin. McGee was also the 1st player to use three balls at the same time in a dunk contest. The Guinness World Records also was mentioning him as the most basketballs dunked in one jump.</p><p>In a 98–79 loss to the Chicago Bulls on March 15, 2011. His career-high twelve blocks were the most since Keon Clark had 12 on March 23, 2001. However, he got some disapproval for taking ill-advised shots in the 4th quarter to make sure that he would score ten points while his group was being blown out, and also got a technical foul for the excessive celebration by pulling himself on the rim after a dunk for his last points. TV commentator Kevin McHale said it was a “bad triple-double”. In reply, McGee said, “I got a triple-double. Who can say they got a triple-double? I’m not worried about it”. At the time of the 2011 NBA lockout, NBPA leaders met with around thirty players on October 14.</p><h4>Further…</h4><p>JaVale quit the meeting early and told reporters there were several players “saying that they’re ready to fold”, but most of them were together. Later he disagreed quoting that players were ready to fold, but his comment was recorded by reporters. Derek Fisher said McGee had “no ability to make that statement” based on the limited time he spent at the meeting. On March 15, 2012, McGee was traded to the Nuggets together with Ronny Turiaf in an exception that dispatched Nenê to the Wizards. As a part of the Wizards, he began 40 of 41 games in which he was present; with the Nuggets, he would begin in 5 of 20 games in which he was present. On March 21, in his Nuggets appearance, he made the game-winning dunk off an Arron Afflalo missed free throw with five seconds left on the clock.</p><p>At the finishing of the regular season, the Nuggets collected the West’s 6th seed, and McGee was present in the 2012 NBA Playoffs, which was his 1st playoff presence in his career. McGee’s series-high was 21 points in Game 5 against 1st-round opposite Los Angeles Lakers. McGee’s numbers were up and down in the series. On July 18, 2012, McGee again signed with the Nuggets on a 4-year, $44 million contract. His 2013–14 season was completed on February 20, 2014, when he had surgery to fix a stress fracture in his left tibia which he underwent on November 8, 2013. On October 29, 2014, McGee went back for the Nuggets and won against the Detroit Pistons.</p><h4>More about his career</h4><p>On February 19, 2015, McGee was together with the rights to Chukwudiebere Maduabum and a 2015 first-round pick, to the Philadelphia 76ers in exchange for the rights to Cenk Akyol. The 76ers were refusing him after being present in 6 games on March 1, 2015. On August 13, 2015, He made a steal together with the Dallas Mavericks. He missed the group’s 1st 13 games of the 2015–16 season because of a stress fracture in his left tibia. Also, on November 22, 2015, he made his appearance for the Mavericks, playing in under eleven minutes off the bench, recording 8 points and 6 rebounds in a loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder. On January 5, 2016, he again won against the Sacramento Kings. The Mavericks decline McGee on July 8, 2016.</p><p>McGee then made a deal with the Golden State Warriors on September 16, 2016. He then got a victory against the New York Knicks on December 15, 2016. Also, on March 31, 2017, he got a victory against the Houston Rockets. The Warriors got a victory against the 2017 NBA Championship after beating the Cleveland Cavaliers in the NBA Finals. He was in the game in 77 of 82 regular-season games. McGee re-made a deal along with the Warriors on a 1-year contract on August 1, 2017. His gaming time was enlarging when he was into the beginning lineup after the all-star break. He won his 2nd straight championship after the Warriors beat the Cavaliers in a 4-game in the Finals in June 2018. He began the final three games of the series and scored 8.0 points in the 4 games.</p><h4>Some more</h4><p>JaVale made a deal with the Los Angeles Lakers on July 10, 2018. He passed out 7 games in December due to a respiratory problem. On March 22, 2019, he was lost to the Brooklyn Nets. Additionally, JaVale was a swap from the Los Angeles Lakers to the Cleveland Cavaliers in a swap for Alfonzo McKinnie and Jordan Bell on November 23, 2020. McGee got an invite to the United States men’s national basketball team’s minicamp in the summer of the year 2009 and also in the summer of 2010. McGee was playing together with Team USA in a scrimmage at Radio City Music Hall at the 2010 World Basketball Festival but after an uneven presentation, he didn’t play in the team’s scrimmage opposite China at Madison Square Garden. It ended on August 15, 2010.</p><p>McGee went to the Philippines twice during the 2011 NBA lockout, 1st in exhibition games with NBA stars against players from the Philippine Basketball Association and the Smart Gilas national team, and then in a basketball clinic. Later the same year, he showed his interest in playing for the Philippine national group. In 2012, a bill was made for his Filipino citizenship to make him eligible to play for Smart Gilas. Moreover, in the year 2014, McGee was asked again by the Gilas Pilipinas to participate as a naturalized player in the 2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup in Spain. But national groups were limited to 1 naturalized player apiece, and a Wizards member Andray Blatche made the World Cup group after he was permitted citizenship.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-94007 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/JaVale-McGee-scoring-the-basketball.jpg alt="JaVale McGee" width=650 height=650 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-94007 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: JaVale McGee scoring the basketball (Source: Instagram)</p><h4><span>Net Worth 2024</span></h4><p>The basketball player has a good <strong>net worth</strong> of around $14 million.
