A hazardous materials emergency and a possible unresponsive person were reported at a property close to 7th and Northern Avenues in Phoenix, Arizona, on November 16 at around 8 am. Police officers and hazmat teams were at the site quickly.&nbsp;</p><p>Firefighters had a tough time entering the house because of a gas leak. Southwest Gas, a nearby utility, cut off service to the residents, and residents were instructed to leave their homes. Before a police investigation in the early afternoon could begin, a hazmat crew spent several hours looking into the house.</p><p>Phoenix Police Sgt Melissa Soliz informed the media during a press conference that two adults and three children had died "with apparent evidence of trauma." The victims' identities were kept a secret. A homicide inquiry has been launched by police. However, Soliz stated, "We do not believe that there is a suspect on the loose right now." In a statement to local media, Southwest Gas claimed that no leaks had been discovered in the region and added, "Our hearts are heavy with today's news and we are grateful for the quick response of first responders."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRoal2Ytaq4w6ucp2WRoryvs4xuZJ%2BnpaOxbrDEmptmmqWbs6K4zmaeq6emmnqpu8yeZLCdnKG7pr%2FSZpqhnZOgeq7B0Z2cq2WjqraktcOe</p></div><div id=links><a href=./gordon-murray.html>&#171;&nbsp;Gordon Murray</a>
