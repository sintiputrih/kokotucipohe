The YouTuber found herself in the hot water after her former fans came forward to allege that she used the platform and the massive fame she amassed as a result, to foster inappropriate relationships with her (mostly underaged) fans.</p>Because of her online character, Miranda Sings, which debuted on YouTube in 2008, Colleen Ballinger gained notoriety. Miranda amassed a devoted fan base of over 10 million users on the website. She is easily recognized by her distinctive red pants and humorously overdone red lipstick. As&nbsp;Rolling Stone&nbsp;described it, Miranda’s brand of comedy is that she’s “rude, entitled, can’t sing, farts and burps for laughs, and shoots down every criticism with the unwavering belief that she’ll be famous.” Learn more about her siblings here.<h3><strong>Who Are Colleen Ballinger Siblings?</strong></h3>Colleen Ballinger is one of the four children of <a href=#>Tim and Gwen Ballinger</a>, residents of Santa Barbara, California.

He has been accused of sending inappropriate messages to a young fan of his sister’s.

Born on 5 April 1991, Rachel is age 32. On September 25, 2006, she originally created her NOVAQUA YouTube account; however, it wasn’t until June 5, 2007, that she uploaded her first video.</p><p>In her “Rachel’s Room,” “Random Tuesdays,” and “Learning Sundays,” Rachel comes out as wild. She has over 832K followers on her second channel, “Rachelvlogs,” where she frequently uploads vlogs. Over 2.76 million people subscribe to Rachel Ballinger, her primary channel.</p><p>Rachel published the first “Rachel’s Room” video in 2014. She responds to questions from her admirers in this series. She also ingeniously started “Learning Sundays,” in which she teaches a subject that has been proposed by her admirers, covering everything from laundry to sex education. Anything that comes to mind that she can’t fit into her normal series is included in her “Random Tuesday/Thursday” videos.</p><p>After eight years of dating, Rachel Ballinger and her boyfriend Matt did split up in the fall of 2020. A vlogger on YouTube for years, Rachel has allowed her followers a peek into her everyday routine. Although Rachel is well known for her humorous vlogs and upbeat films about her life, it seems that she prefers to keep her love life a secret. At the end of 2020, rumors started to circulate that Rachel and her longtime boyfriend, Matt, had broken up.</p><p>When Rachel’s sister Colleen posted a TikTok video in December 2020, it led viewers to believe that the YouTuber and Matt had broken up. When it suggested in the video to “put a finger down if you broke up with someone this year,” fans saw Rachel begin to do so before she laughed and left the frame.</p><p>In one video posted in late January of 2021, Rachel told the camera: “I have not talked to my ex in over a month. We broke up in September and I have not talked to this man in over a month. I have tried because we were intertwined for eight years.” After that, Rachel began shouting, as though upset that Matt hadn’t answered all of her inquiries. She once became frustrated because she was unable to log in to remove charges on her credit card.</p><p>Fans didn’t anticipate seeing a tell-all vlog detailing Rachel’s separation from Matt because she has a history of keeping her personal life very secret. She did, however, vlog about how their breakup gave her the freedom to completely explore her sexuality in a later post. Rachel came out as gay on a vlog in February 2021.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>Where Do Colleen Ballinger Siblings Reside?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Colleen Ballinger’s siblings are residing in California.
