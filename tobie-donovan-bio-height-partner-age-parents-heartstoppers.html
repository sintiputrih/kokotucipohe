style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>Heartstopper is a British coming-of-age romance based on 2016’s webcomic and graphic novel of the same name by Alice Oseman, which ended up selling over a million print copies.</p><p>And on the series that dropped on Netflix on 22 April 2022, actor Tobie Donovan’s Isaac Henderson is the only role specifically created for the Netflix series as the character does not feature in Alice Oseman’s original graphic novel. That was one more reason this turned out to be Tobie’s biggest dream come true.</p><p>Now, read through this ‘Tobie Donovan Bio’ and find out all about his height, partner, age, parents, and Heartstopper&nbsp;journey.</p><h3><strong>Tobie Donovan On Heartstopper</strong></h3><p>For Tobie Donovan, Hearstopper has truly been the craziest and most exciting experience of his life. He stars&nbsp;as one new addition Isaac Henderson, alongside Rhea Norwood as Imogen Heaney.</p><p>Isaac is an introverted member of Charlie (actor<a href=#> Joe Locke</a>), Tao (actor <a href=#>William Gao</a>), and Elle’s (actress <a href=#>Yasmin Finney</a>) friend circle. He would rather be reading a novel most of his time than be dealing with any drama. But this does not mean that he is not a solid, supportive friend in the core group.</p><p>Isaac may not have been born by creator Alice Oseman. But he sure gets her approval as well. Most recently on Twitter, she could not stop talking about him. “He’s a bookworm and doesn’t say much, but when he does, it’s usually very insightful and/or funny. He doesn’t have a huge arc of his own this season, but I have maaaany plans for him in future seasons”, about the onscreen newcomer. She wished him better luck with the actor that portrayed her favorite character in the show.</p><p>Most recently on his Instagram, Tobie also thanked the series’ executive producers Patrick Walters, Euros Lyn, and casting director Daniel Edwards-Guy, along with Alice Oseman, for believing in him and trusting him to tell Isaac’s story.</p><p>Like the original story, Heartstopper, the live-action version of Heartstopper follows two schoolboys, and the romantic tensions simmer beneath their developing friendship. Gentle Charlie and rugby-loving Nick meet at secondary school and quickly discover their unlikely friendship blossoming into an unexpected romance. All along the couple with their circle of friends, including Isaac, navigate the ever-relatable journey of self-discovery and acceptance, supporting each other as they learn to find their most authentic selves.</p><p>Its creator Alice, at first, did not make any money out of it. It was just a passion project for her. She was just uploading it for free online. And now it has been made into a TV show, she feels really weird about it.</p><h3><strong>Tobie Donovan Net Worth</strong></h3><p>Tobie Donovan reportedly had less than $100K as net worth as of April 2022.</p><p>He is a newcomer, making his debut in the series, and is represented by Independent Talent Group, Europe’s leading talent and literary agency.</p><h3><strong>Does Tobie Donovan Have A Partner?</strong></h3><p>Tobie Dovan had already come out as gay before the age of 19. He wrote in a tweet in November 2021 that he almost felt like a superhero himself getting to play a part in Heartstopper. He said it showed him he can be gay and still be a superhero. Then, he said, that he cannot imagine how it must feel for a kid who is still in the closet.</p><p>As for the fan’s burning question “Does Tobie has a partner?”, his relationship status remained likely a mystery with no hint on his social media.</p><p>Tobie seemed pretty close to his Heartstopper&nbsp;co-star Rhea Norwood. But clearly, they were not dating.</p><h3><strong>Tobie Donovan Height</strong></h3><p>Very charming Tobie Donivan stands around 5’11” tall in height.</p><h3><strong>Tobie Donovan Age</strong></h3><p>Tobie Donovan turned 19 years old in 2021.</p><h3><strong>Who Are Tobie Donovan Parents?</strong></h3><p>Tobie’s dad Neil Donovan is a business owner of a landscape company called The Bath Gardener. People went to him for garden clearance and maintenance, hedge trimming, patio cleaning & re-pointing, decking, fencing, shrubs, and roses pruned, weeds controlled and bulbs planted. Through his work, the gardening enthusiast is said to have created very memorable green landscapes and sanctuaries.</p><p>In his family, Tobie has a baby sister who at this point had turned 17 years old. And often on Instagram, Neil has expressed that he is very proud of both of his kids.</p><p>As for Tobie’s mum, we were unable to find any information on her.
