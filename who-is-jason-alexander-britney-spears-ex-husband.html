separated and the “Circus” singer holds a restraining order against her ex-husband.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=300 data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false>Now that the man is in the news again <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">for getting arrested in Tennessee for stalking</a>, interest in the lurking blast from the past in Spears’ life is getting renewed interest. Just who is Jason Alexander, an individual who continues to attract attention despite not being a celebrity spouse anymore?</p><h2 id=h-introducing-jason-alexander-britney-spears-first-husband-of-55-hours data-injectable=false>Introducing Jason Alexander, Britney Spears’ first husband of 55 hours</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Jason-Alexander-Britney-Spears-ex-husband.jpg><p data-characters=336 data-current-count=336 data-injectable=false>Alexander was Spears’ childhood friend, whom she had known since they were both kids growing up in Kentwood Louisiana. If previous assertions of Alexander — a former college football player — are to be believed, he and the singer were friends “with benefits” between 1999 and 2002 — when Spears was dating Justin Timberlake.</p><p data-characters=222 data-current-count=558 data-injectable=true>Fast-forward to Jan. 3, 2004, when Alexander was studying at Southeastern Louisiana University,&nbsp;the duo (22 at the time) got hitched in Las Vegas, Nevada, only for the impromptu marriage to be annulled 55 hours later.</p><p data-characters=218 data-current-count=218 data-injectable=false>Interestingly, they remember the hows and whats differently. As shared by the Grammy-winning singer in a chat with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">E! Online</a>, the marriage was a “silly” idea that took form after she was done partying in Las Vegas.</p><p>“I think I was running away from something, I didn’t quite know what.”</p><p data-characters=174 data-current-count=483 data-injectable=true>The court documents of the said annulment stated that Britney “lacked understanding of her actions, to the extent that she was incapable of agreeing to the marriage.”</p><p data-characters=295 data-current-count=295 data-injectable=false>But to this day, Alexander recounts a very different chain of events. Back in 2012, he revealed to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ABC News</a> that getting a whirlwind wedding in Las Vegas was Spears’ idea as she was the one who asked him. He agreed because he was “in love with her” and thought “she felt the same way.”</p><p data-characters=370 data-current-count=665 data-injectable=true>In 2021, he shared his version of what went down in January of 2004 with the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Daily Mail</a>. According to him, it was Britney’s parents and her team, along with “men in black,” who forced a very unwilling Spears and Alexander to annul their marriage “under duress.” He agreed because they tricked him into believing their marriage would dismantle Spears’ career.</p><p>“I loved her and was a naive kid who had been raised to trust and respect my elders, just like she had. They told me if I would sign the contracts, the annulment, they would let me and Britney continue our relationship.”</p><p data-characters=183 data-current-count=414 data-injectable=true>But after 30 days — the period it took to get the annulment finalized — Spears’ phone number was changed, ending what Alexander claims were days of constant communication.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=318 data-current-count=318 data-injectable=false>While Britney has hardly ever spoken about Alexander, he has been, in his way, her supporter. In 2020, when the #FreeBritney movement picked up steam, he talked about supporting it and stressed that based on their “personal conversations” he had gathered that she detested the conservatorship controlling her life.</p><h2 id=h-2023-ain-t-the-first-time-jason-alexander-has-been-accused-of-stalking data-injectable=false>2023 ain’t the first time Jason Alexander has been accused of stalking</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Britney-Spears-and-ex-husband-Jason-Alexander.jpg><p data-characters=335 data-current-count=335 data-injectable=false>He added the crime to his profile in 2022, when he broke into the “Toxic” singer’s home on June 9, 2022 – hours before her nuptials with her current husband Sam Asghari. He live-streamed the entire drama, claiming that Britney Spears invited him to her wedding, and he obliged because “she’s my first wife. My only wife.”</p><p>“I’m here to crash the wedding cause nobody [is] here but Sam. So where the f–k’s the family?”</p><p data-characters=373 data-current-count=373 data-injectable=false>The whole ordeal, which left Spears’ pretty shaken, ended when the police arrived and took Alexander into custody, when he was charged with stalking, vandalism, aggravated trespass, and battery, and spent 128 days in Ventura County Jail. Soon after, the singer got a three-year restraining order against him, under which he has to stay at least a 100 yards away from her.</p><p data-characters=319 data-current-count=692 data-injectable=false>But being arrested — and getting married less than a year (March 27, 2023) after the above fiasco — hasn’t deterred Alexander from still talking or posting about Spears (his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram bio</a> still has the link to the above-mentioned DailyMail article from 2021), or well, as we can see, resolved his stalking habits.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqbuMoqpmopGovK95wKWcsZmembKzecGroK2mla56tLzEmqmsZZWteqnB0puYp5xf</p></div><div id=links><a href=./colby-donaldson-the-butcher.html>&#171;&nbsp;'Survivor' Alum Colby Donaldson Is 'The Butcher Host Is He Married?</a>
