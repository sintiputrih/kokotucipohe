Over the next 2 days, it poured down rain, our big basil plant got overwatered, and now it‚Äôs sort of falling over on itself. It‚Äôs a good thing we planted two! It‚Äôs also a good thing that we‚Äôre not farmers because we can barely keep a few deck plants alive üôÇ We went to the farmers market last to get produce from ACTUAL farmers on Saturday, and I brought home these cute mini zucchini and tiny pattypan squashes.

My go-to easy ‚Äúmeals‚Äù were those tiny cardboard-flavored frozen veggie burgers. I‚Äôd eat them for dinner and I‚Äôd bring them to cookouts‚Ä¶ they tasted terrible and everyone around me thought I was a little crazy. It wasn‚Äôt long until I quit frozen veggie burgers altogether. A few weeks ago, we gave the Beyond Burger a whirl and wow(!), have plant-based burgers come a long way!

We have a ton of basil and some very fragrant Thai basil, among other plants like Thai chiles, tomatoes, peppers, and even figs. We‚Äôre very proud of our little plant escape, and when I say ‚Äúwe‚Äù I mean that I‚Äôm very proud that Jack has been lovingly watering everything up to twice a day to keep it all going. This might be the longest that we‚Äôve actually kept plants alive.

If you said panzanella, you‚Äôre at the right place. If you didn‚Äôt say panzanella, that‚Äôs ok too, because I think you‚Äôll be converted after you try this one! üôÇ It‚Äôs the ultimate summer salad to make with a bounty of fresh tomatoes. Or in this case, if you have a few tomatoes and a bounty of fresh sweet corn. Panzanella may be an Italian bread salad, but the special part about this panzanella is that it‚Äôs not entirely about the bread. I think bread salads can often get a bit too bread-y, which‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>I love a Chipotle burrito bowl as much as the next person, but for my money, this sweet and spicy vegan burrito bowl recipe is just as good. While making it may not be quite&nbsp;as quick as grabbing lunch to-go, it‚Äôs still pretty easy to make, thanks to a secret ingredient: chipotles in adobo sauce! The sauce acts as a 1-ingredient marinade for meaty portobello mushroom caps, and I mix pinto and black beans with the chopped peppers to infuse them with some heat. A scoop of pineapple salsa adds a delicious sweet contrast, while burrito bowl essentials ‚Äì fajita‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Lately, my fridge has been overloaded with vegetables! We‚Äôve been hitting one, if not two, farmers markets each week. After a long winter, I‚Äôm still in awe that we‚Äôre able to leave the house, enjoy the fresh air, and peruse rows and rows of glorious vegetables. I want to buy them all! It‚Äôs hard for me to hold back, even though I‚Äôm mindful of what we‚Äôll actually be able to eat in a week. Another thing that‚Äôs hard to hold ‚Äì my heavy veggie bags as Jack runs off to find the nearest cheese sandwich vendor.

Ours has been pretty chill ‚Äì we went to the farmers market, Jack played video games, and I did some baking. I‚Äôm excited to share this lovely little pound cake recipe with you because I think it‚Äôs the perfect Sunday afternoon treat. It‚Äôs lightly sweet and nicely spiced. Yogurt makes it tangy while giving it a nice puffed up look. It‚Äôs moist with that perfect cake-y crumb that you want in a quick bread.

Over the years, I‚Äôve tried all sorts of vegan ice cream recipes, ones with bases ranging from frozen bananas to cashew milk to almond milk. For me, there‚Äôs no contest. As far as dairy-free ice cream goes, coconut ice cream is by far the best. Full-fat coconut milk adds enough richness to create a texture that is super creamy, smooth, and not at all icy. It‚Äôs rich, decadent, and every bit as good as the real thing.

I feel like they get a bad rap because the grocery store versions with the sad celery, raw cauliflower, and grubby carrots are never the most exciting appetizer at a party, but this board fixes that by being bright, fun, and delicious! It‚Äôs a yummy mix of fresh things, salty/savory bites, and even a sweet element from the delectable Tart Cherry Thyme Compound Butter. Each little recipe is made up of super simple combinations of creative ingredients that, together, make a really unique crudit√© platter!

I did a poll on&nbsp;Instagram last week asking which strawberry rhubarb dessert I should make. If you were one of the many that voted for crumble bars ‚Äì you win! Well, actually, I win too, because these strawberry rhubarb bars are super yummy. They‚Äôre nutty, oat-y, and crisp, with that irresistible sweet/tart strawberry rhubarb flavor. Of course, they‚Äôre a delicious dessert, but they‚Äôre also pretty healthy, so I wouldn‚Äôt blame you for eating one (or more) for breakfast either.

It‚Äôs full of colorful produce, like cherry tomatoes, yellow squash, and green beans, and artichokes and olives add delicious briny flavor. To tie it all together, I make a tangy, creamy tahini dressing. Because this dressing is totally mayo-free, it travels extremely well. As a result, this vegan pasta salad is a perfect dish to bring to a cookout or picnic. It‚Äôs so fresh, vibrant, and fun that I‚Äôm planning to make it all summer long.
