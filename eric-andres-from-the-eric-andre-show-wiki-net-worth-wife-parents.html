He looks familiar and like a big celebrity, but you might not be fully aware as to whys he is so famous. Eric is a comedian and actor, and his fame has grown through planning his own show, <a rel=nofollow href=#>“The Eric Andre Show”</a>, before which he was best known for his roles in the “Man Seeking Woman” comedy series on FXX. Apparently, this comedian/actor is brave enough to showcase his talents and boldness to the world after struggling to break through, as with his early role in the 2009 movie ‘The Invention of Lying’. Obviously, his fortitude and resilience have been the key to his rapid rise in popularity.</p><h2><span id=Early_life_and_education>Early life and education</span></h2><p>Eric Samuel Andre was born on <a rel=nofollow href=#>4th of April 1983</a>, in Boca Raton, Florida. His father is Haitian and works as a psychiatrist, and his mother is Jewish-American. Interestingly, Eric identifies himself as both Jewish and black, and more precisely his ancestry as Ashkenazi and Afro-Haitian. Eric has an older sister, Amy Andre. He matriculated from Dreyfoos School of the Arts in 2001, located in West Palm Beach, Florida. After that, he has made his greatest choice of enrolling in studies at Berklee College of Music, Boston, Massachusetts, where he focused on playing double bass most of the time before graduating in 2005, not knowing he would find himself in a slightly different career choice.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/affairpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/L4YUT6p.jpg><h2><span id=Personal_dating_life>Personal dating life</span></h2><p>For the most part, Andre has succeeded in keeping his private love life more hidden compared with other celebs. However, some information is known to the public – from 2012 to 2014 he <a rel=nofollow href=#>dated the American actress Tatyana Ali</a>, but this was always wrapped in mystery and suspicions as to whether it was true. Then in 2015 he dated the curvy blonde Amber Rose (ex- of Kanye and of Wiz Khalifa), but he regretfully remembers this failed relationship. His last girlfriend was Rosario Dawson, who dated him from 2016 to 2017, apparently, as this breakup is still not confirmed. So far, Andre has not had any kids or marriages in his past.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Starting a band with <a rel=nofollow href=#>@TVCARNAGE</a> and @Ocasio2018 ? ? ? <a rel=nofollow href=#>pic.twitter.com/7ZCgywrIcW</a></p><p>— Eric Andre (@ericandre) <a rel=nofollow href=#>June 28, 2018</a></p><h2><span id=Career_and_net_worth>Career and net worth</span></h2><p>The salary of Eric is not known or defined as to it’s source, but his net worth is authoritatively estimated to be $500.000. However, he did not reach this amount by doing nothing, as he has engaged himself seriously in honing his acting and musical skills. His acting has been seen in ‘Don’t Trust the B—- in Apartment 23’, and with co-starring roles in ‘2 Broke Girls’, also ‘The Big Bang Theory’, ‘Convention Panels’ and ‘Should’ve been Romeo’ among other shows too. In 2014, Andre was nominated at Streamy Awards as part of the Best Ensemble Cast in ‘The ArScheerio Paul Show’.</p><p>Posted by <a rel=nofollow href=#>The Eric Andre Show Live</a> on&nbsp;<a rel=nofollow href=#>Saturday, November 16, 2013</a></p><h2><span id=The_fame_of_The_Eric_Andre_Show>The fame of ‘The Eric Andre Show’</span></h2><p>He has created his masterpiece ‘The Eric Andre Show’, in which he is a clever host who displays his own parody-of-the public access shows, presenting shock humor, pranks and sketches among other things.</p><p><br>This show is basically a satiric and surreal humorous show on the late-night block of Cartoon Network, and first aired on 20 May 2012, on which he practically mocks all talk shows in his own childish style. In total there have been four seasons each of 10 episodes. What makes it unique is the frequent destruction of furnishings or objects, with the band playing in the background, and some stunts too. The subject of <a rel=nofollow href=#>The Eric Andre Show</a> is about two guys who talk as a perfect duo of wild temper and down-to-earth brains. This show has had some amazing celebs as its guests, but also with impersonators of George Clooney, Beyonce and Jay Z, Jerry Seinfield, Schwarzenegger, The Hulk and Russel Brand among others.</p><h2><span id=Height_and_Ethnicity>Height and Ethnicity</span></h2><p>Eric Andre can be described as a man of slim build with a weight of 77 kg or 170 lbs. He is a tall man and stands at a height of 6 feet or 1.83&nbsp;m. When it comes to Eric’s ethnicity, he is Ashkenazi Jewish and Afro-Haitian, he&nbsp;has curly black hair and dark brown eyes. His other body measurements are currently unavailable which also applies to his diet plan and work out routine. But it can be expected that the comedian does put in an effort to stay in shape.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOnqmim12Wu6W%2BxKxkn6qfonq1tMRmnKuhk2Kur7DRnmSsoJ%2Bseri1yqJkp52kYsSwvtOhZLChlpp6sa3RnqWtq18%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./frosted-lemon-cookies.html>&#171;&nbsp;Frosted Lemon Cookies Modern Honey</a>
