However, Tosh’s comedic timing and sense of humor were a perfect fit for the format, and just like that, Comedy Central had a fresh hit on its hands.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dave Chappelle Goes Hard In Latest Stand-up Special, Free To Watch On YouTube</a></span></p><p>Initially given 10 episodes, things changed quickly for the show, and soon, more episodes were coming down the pipe.
