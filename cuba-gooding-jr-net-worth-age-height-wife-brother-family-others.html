He went on to star in a series of notable films throughout the 90s until the new millennium.&nbsp;However, from the mid-2000s, Gooding’s career began to dwindle.</span></p><p>He appeared in a string of lesser-known live-action films that received little critical attention.&nbsp;It lasted more than a decade, a period of his career that Gooding described as a wasteland phase and blames himself for as well.&nbsp;Thankfully, in recent years, Gooding seems to have come back into the spotlight, thanks to his role as OJ Simpson in Ryan Murphy’s&nbsp;<span>American Crime Story</span><span>.&nbsp;We walk you through his journey to Hollywood stardom and also touch on several aspects of his personal life.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=cuba-gooding-jr-%e2%80%93-bio-age></span><strong><span>Cuba Gooding Jr – Bio, Age</span></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Cuba Michael Gooding Jr. was born on January 2, 1968, in the Bronx, New York in Cuba and Shirley Gooding, both singers in their own right.&nbsp;Her mother Shirley was one of the backup vocalists of the 60s band,&nbsp;</span><span>Sweetheart</span><span>&nbsp;while her father was the lead singer of the R&B group,&nbsp;</span><span>Main Ingredient</span><span>&nbsp;who shot to fame in 1972 with their hit&nbsp;</span><span>Everybody Plays It. crazy</span></p><p><span>Thanks to his father’s music, the family moved to Los Angeles when Cuba was 4 years old.&nbsp;At the age of six, her father left the family in the sole care of her mother.&nbsp;The Cuban mother struggled to afford rent, so she had to jump with the children from place to place.&nbsp;Some days they slept in budget hotels and others in cars.</span></p><p>As a result of the constant movement, Cuba attended four different secondary schools.&nbsp;However, the frequent moves had little or no effect on his fitness.&nbsp;He served as class president at three of the high schools he attended and was heavily involved in extracurricular activities including dance, acting, and sports.</p><p><span>In the mid-1980s, Gooding began appearing in films and it wasn’t long before he got his first break with&nbsp;</span><span>Boyz the Hood</span><span>&nbsp;which was both a commercial and critical success.&nbsp;Her career took a huge leap after she won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her role in&nbsp;</span><span>Jerry Maguire</span><span>&nbsp;(1996).&nbsp;Cuba Goding Jr continues to be active in the entertainment business.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=net-value></span><strong><span>Net value</span></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Cuba Gooding Jr. Sure, he made a ton of money acting, though that wild decade of starring in back-to-back live-action films nearly bankrupted him.&nbsp;During her vacation, Gooding could earn $3 million for just one role.&nbsp;His net worth is estimated between $10-15 million.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=brother></span><strong><span>Brother</span></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Cuba Gooding has two brothers namely;&nbsp;Tommy Gooding and Omar Gooding.&nbsp;Perhaps the more popular of the two is Omar who, like Cuba, is an actor.&nbsp;Apart from acting, Omar also has great vocal abilities.&nbsp;Omar was born on October 19, 1976 in Los Angeles, California.</span></p><p><span>He began his career in show business in the early 1990s and is best known for his roles on the small screen.&nbsp;He has made guest appearances on television shows such as&nbsp;</span><span>Touched by an Angel,&nbsp;</span><span>Hangin’ with Mr. Cooper, Ringleaders</span><span>, and&nbsp;</span><span>Grey’s Anatomy</span><span>.&nbsp;Some of his notable films include;&nbsp;</span><span>Ghost Dad, Baby Boy,</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>Mr. Box Office.</span></p><p><span>Every Gooding seems to have a musical side and Omar is no exception.&nbsp;He’s a good rapper.&nbsp;Omar attended North Hollywood High School where he graduated in 1994.</span></p><p><span>Tommy Gooding is perhaps the one who really inherited most of their father’s musical genes.&nbsp;Tommy served as musical director of his father’s touring band during his father’s active years.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=wife-family></span><strong><span>wife, family</span></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Cuba Gooding Jr. in

2014, news broke that the two men had separated and Kapfer filed for divorce seeking joint physical and legal custody of their three children.&nbsp;Spencer, Mason and Piper.</span></p><p>According to TMZ, Sara Kapfer’s filing cited irreconcilable differences as grounds for the divorce.&nbsp;Despite news about divorce filings, the media does not know how the divorce was finalized and if it ever was.</p><p><span>Reports later emerged that after the divorce filings, the couple continued to see each other from time to time.&nbsp;Gooding will then file his own papers in January 2017. Cuban sons Spencer and Mason were born in 1994 and 1996 respectively, while Piper was born in 2005.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=height-and-other-facts></span><strong><span>Height and other facts</span></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>1.
